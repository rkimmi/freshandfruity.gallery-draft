# Fresh and fruity gallery practice round

#### Step one
install node & npm, and (optionally) yarn. 

clone this repository, run `npm install` or `yarn` to install dependencies.

#### Step two
run the dev script using `yarn dev` or `npm run dev`, go to localhost3000 in your browser.

#### Step three
check out a new branch using `git checkout -b branchname`, or if the branch already exists, `git checkout branchname`.

#### Step four 
make some changes. client/components/App.jsx is a good place to start.
the script `dev` is listening to any changes to files, so no need to run it again. just refresh on localhost:3000 to confirm any changes. 

While your at it, download the React developer tools extension.

#### Step five
send your changes to github;

`git add .` to add all changes, or `git add filename` to add changes of a specific file,

`git commit -m 'message about changes'`,

`git push origin branchname`.

#### Step six
check that changes have made it to github. when ready, create a 'new pull request' to merge `yourbranch` with `master`. 

assign your partner to review your request, don't merge your own request! also leave a nice note.

# Fresh and fruity gallery

### Step one
install node & npm, and (optionally) yarn
clone this repository, run *npm install* or *yarn* to install dependencies

### Step two
run the dev script using *yarn dev* or *npm run dev*, go to localhost3000 in the browser

### Step three
check out a new branch using *git checkout -b branchname*, or if the branch already exists, *git checkout branchname*

### Step four 
make some changes. Client/components/App.jsx is a good place to start.
*git add .* to add all changes, or *git add filename* to add only changes to a specific file,
*git commit -m 'message about changes',
*git push origin branchname*

### Step five
check that changes have made it to github. when ready, create a new pull request to merge *yourbranchname* with *master*. assign your partner to review your request, don't merge your own request! also leave a nice note.
